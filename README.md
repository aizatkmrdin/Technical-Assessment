### Folder Structure

Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```

Technical-assessment/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- linux
|- macos
|- test
|- web
|- windows

```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```

lib/
|- constants/
|- models/
|- screens/
|- utilities/
|- widgets/
|- main.dart

```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```

1- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `theme`, `date format`, and `strings` .
2- models - Contains models of data listing.
3- screens - Contains screens of application.
4- utilitiesâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains the utilities/common functions of your application.
5- widgetsâ€Šâ€”â€ŠContains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc.
6- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

```

### Constants

This directory contains all the application level constants. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```

constants/
|- color.dart
|- date.dart
|- style.dart

```

### Models

All the list of model to ease the control of chunk of data.

```

models/
|- todo.dart
|- todo.g.dart

```

### Screens

This directory contains all the ui of your application. Each screen is located in a separate folder making it easy to combine group of files related to that particular screen. All the screen specific widgets will be placed in `widgets` directory as shown in the example below:

```

screens/
|- home
|- todo_form.dart

```

### Utilities

Contains the common file(s) and utilities used in a project. The folder structure is as follows:

```

utils/
|- db_container.dart
|- servicers.dart

```

### Widgets

Contains the common widgets that are shared across multiple screens. For example, Button, TextField etc.

```

widgets/
|- custom_button.dart
|- fill_form.dart
|- todo_cart.dart

```
